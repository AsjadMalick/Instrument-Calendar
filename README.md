WELCOME TO INSTRUMENT CALENDAR BY  Asjad Hassan Malick, Mar 2016

PATCH 1.4 UPDATE APRIL 2016:  
Changed the UI, 
Months can no longer be overwritten and DELETE button was removed.
Made creating month ram conservative. (No background program runs if error occurs)
Added hourly slots for TOC UV-VIS and FTIR machines.

For there to be little problems a WINDOWS XP machine or newer is recommended
(Optimized for Windows 8.1)

Double click the shortcut that was inside the file, or the actual .exe itself
to run the software. 
Note the month data will be saved to whatever folder the .exe is in. Does not 
matter where the shortcut goes.

PRESSING THE RED X BUTTON ON ANY WINDOW AT ANY TIME TERMINATES THE PROGRAM
***One window is an exception to this rule, will be denoted by astriks***

HOW TO USE:

1. In the first Menu Select the machine whose schedule you wish to see/edit.

3. Next type in the year in the top field.

4. Select the desired month.

5. Press one of the buttons and Voila the calander opens up!

6. Green: Both AM and PM are available (less than half are taken)
   Yellow: One of AM OR PM is open (half are taken)
   Red: Neither AM or PM are open (all are taken)

7. Click any day to pull up a ***window*** detailing information of that day.

8. Use the OK button to save changes to the frame, EDIT button to change if the 
   fields are locked

9. MAKE SURE TO HIT THE SAVE BUTTON ON THE CALENDAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   CHANGES WILL BE LOST IF YOU DONT DO THIS.

10. Hit the red X button on the calendar to terminate the program. (Again hit
 	save before you do this).


*************TROUBLESHOOTING******************
1. After Pressing CREATE CALENDAR, A FILE ALREADY EXISTS Message appears in the field
   - This is because the motnh has already been made, clear the field, retype the year,
     then hit load calendar.

2. After hitting the save button the window crashes
	- This is because an error occured while saving, contact System 
	Administrator as it is most likley an access issue.

3. After Pressing Load Calendar, a FILE NOT FOUND Message appears in the field.

  - This is because the file has not been created, remove the text, retype the year
    then hit create calander.

  - OR This is beacuse the file is NOT in the same FOLDER as the EXE file. Move the 
    file to the APPLICATION DATA FOLDER  and this should resolve issues.
